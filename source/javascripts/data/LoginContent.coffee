Wiki Ed is excited to announce that we will be launching a new set of tools for creating and tracking a Wikipedia assignment for the Fall 2015 term. You may look through the wizard now, but we are advising instructors teaching with Wikipedia in the fall to wait for our new tools to be ready to plan their assignments.
